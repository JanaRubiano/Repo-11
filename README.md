### Disclaimer:
For this challenge I applied a couple of concepts that haven't been tought yet in the course, those are the **zip **function and the** asterisk (*)**. I knew this before, so I wanted to solve the problems using these tools.



I used **zip** for transposing matrices. 
```python
l1 = [1, 2, 3]
l2 = [4, 5, 6]
l3 = list(zip(l1, l2))
print(l3)

[(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]
```
The above code returns tuples stored in a list.

I used the **asterisk** to unpack iterables, like a matrix that is a list of lists.
